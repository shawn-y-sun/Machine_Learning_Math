# Mathematics for Machine Learning - Code Template

## 1. Linear Algebra
**Identifying Special Matrices**
A function that will test if a 4x4 matrix is singular
1. convert a matrix to echelon form, 
2. Then test if this fails by leaving zeros that can't be removed on the leading diagonal

**Gram-Schmidt process**
A function to perform the Gram-schmidt procedure, which takes a list of vectors and forms an orthonormal basis from this set

**Reflecting Bear**
A function that will produce a transformation matrix for reflecting vectors in an arbitrarily angled mirror

**Page Rank**
In this notebook, you'll build on your knowledge of eigenvectors and eigenvalues by exploring the PageRank algorithm. The notebook is in two parts:
- the first is a worksheet to get you up to speed with how the algorithm works - here we will look at a micro-internet with fewer than 10 websites and see what it does and what can go wrong. 
- the second is an assessment which will test your application of eigentheory to this problem by writing code and calculating the page rank of a large network representing a sub-section of the internet.

## 2. Multivariate Calculus
**The Sandpit**
Builds an understanding of what the Jacobian is, and how this can be used to find the minimum of a function

**Backpropagation**
Trains a neural network to draw a curve by implementing backpropagation by the chain rule to calculate Jacobians of the cost function

**Gradient descent in a sandpit**
Examines strategies for steepest descent and how effective they are at finding the supervisor's mobile phone

**Fitting the distribution of heights data**
Implements the steepest descent algorithm on the least squares fitting problem for modelling the distribution of heights in a population with a Gaussian

## 3. PCA
**Mean/covariance of a dataset and effect of a linear transformation**
Computes means and (co)variances of data sets and the effect of linear transformations of the data sets on the mean and covariance

**Inner products and angles**
Computes distances and angles between images and compare images from the MNIST dataset

**Orthogonal projections**
- Implements orthogonal projection which projects data onto lower-dimensional subspaces
- Then applies this to the problem of "eigenfaces" which will help you understand the application of orthogonal projection in the real world

**Principal Components Analysis (PCA)**
1. Implement the main steps of PCA, 
2. Apply it to an image data set.
3. Implement PCA for high-dimensional dataset and perform a brief analysis of computation time.
